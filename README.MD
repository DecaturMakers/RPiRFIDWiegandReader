The front (East) door to Decatur Makers makerspace can be opened by active members with their RFID fob. These fobs are read by an ERK871 RFID reader, which sends both serial and Wiegand style data. We use 26 bit Wiegand fobs as of May, 2021.

The reader is powered by a 120V/24V power supply, which is connected to a custom circuit board that:
- sends 24V to the door motor
- sends 12V to the ERK871
- receives both a 3V supply (tonic, over pin 1) and a 3V control signal (on pin 22) from a Raspberry Pi Zero W

The Raspberry Pi Zero W sends 3V over GPIO pin 1 to both the low voltage side of a logic level converter (to step down the 5V Wiegand data), and to the power supply circuit described above. It also sends 5V over GPIO pin 2 to the high voltage side of the logic level converter.

The Raspberry Pi Zero W receives Weigand data (data0 and data 1) stepped down to 3V from 5V on GPIO pins 17 and 18. Note that these are numbered 0 and 1 in the WiringPi standard, which is implemented in wiegand_rpi via the WiringPi library. Do not connect Wiegand data sources directly to the raspberry pi as they run at 5V and will damage the Raspberry Pi. Pin 3 is the common ground for the 12V power supply, the RFID reader, and the Raspberry Pi (and it's 5V power supply provided by a 12V/5V stepper)

When a fob is passed near the reader, wiegand_rpi interprets the 26 bit fob data and sends the digital "full code" of the fob, a 10-digit number with three leading zeroes, to stdout.

door.sh is a script that runs as a service that will start at boot and runs wiegand_rpi, waiting for this 10-digit number. It searches the file rfidtags.txt for the number, and if found, sends 3V over GPIO pin 22 to the control input on the custom circuit board described above - this closes the relay sending 24V to the door motor. The signal stays on for 5 sec (and is also sent to an LED.)

get-fobs.py is scheduled (via crontab) to run at 5A each day and calls NeonCRM (our membership payment, donation, etc. CRM provider) via its API and gets a list of members whose membership expiration date is after the date 7 years before the current timestamp.
